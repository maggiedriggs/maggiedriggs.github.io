title: Art Portfolio
description:  
        Engineering and art may seem like separate disciplines, but for me, they are deeply interconnected. My art portraits reflect how I see the world, with attention to detail, structure, and emotion. Just as engineering solves problems with precision and purpose, art captures complexity and human nuance. 
        Including my artwork in this portfolio is intentional. Drawing portraits has taught me how to observe closely, think spatially, and approach challenges creatively which are skills that are just as essential in engineering as they are in the studio!
        In a world that increasingly values interdisciplinary thinking, I believe that blending art with engineering leads to more thoughtful, and human focused design. This portfolio represents not just what I can build, but how I think. Creatively, critically, and holistically.
