title: EK 210 - Desk Lamp
description:  A group of four and I was tasked to produce desk lamp for people with limited motor skills and light sensitivity to meet their needs. When browsing different stores like Home Depot, Amazon, or Target, the most common desk lamp is one with a standard light setting and an on/off switch. Users with limited fine motor skills may struggle to operate these types of controls, and the client prefers blue light to be emitted in the morning, and red light in the evening.
skills: 
- Circuitry
- Laser Cutting
- CNC Milling
- Soldering
- Arduino & Interfacing
