# Projects!

## Sheet Metal Rose
{% include image-gallery.html images="SheetMetal.png" height="400" %} 
Drew the project on Solidworks and then uploaded the file to the water jet. Optimized material space in the water jet to minimize waste. Deburred the edges of the flower piece and polished. Used a chiesel and mallet to make patterns in each of the flowers and veins in the stem. Assembled it with a metal wire, screws, and a clamp. That's how you plant a flower in the machine shop!

## Standing Moving Spinner
{% include image-gallery.html images="1Stander.png" height="400" %} 
Injection molded feet, brass knob turned on the lathe, laser cut/engraved base and handle, CNC mill structure programmed with Gibbscam and viced to base. Ensuring that the sliders will move smoothly without too much force, measurements on the mill to create slots. Assembly of materials with screws. Creating holes for flat head and socket head screws. 
Finished project that can stand and be spun   

## Pink Panther 4 Bar Linkage
{% include image-gallery.html images="Pink.png" height="400" %} 
Velocity calculations of 4 bars in SolidWorks. Restriction of the bars had to spin continuously without crossing and all moving parts had to be contained in square.
Drew panther with splines and extrusions. Assembled all four bars SolidWorks with mechanical components of screws and washers from McMaster-Carr. Added a motor to one of the bars and found velocity and time to spin one rotation  

## Deburring Tools Sheet Metal Holder
{% include image-gallery.html images="2Deburring.png" height="400" %} 
In the machine shop, there wasn't a good place to keep the deburring tools, so I designed a deburring holder to hang on the side of the tool case. I first measured the deburrers and made a drawing. I tested the pattern on cardboard first on the laser cutters and made changes as it was too small after bending. I fixed this on the SolidWorks model using their sheet metal bending settings and then cut the part on the water jet and bent it into desired shape. Now can be used for shop organization.  

## OnShape Portrait
{% include image-gallery.html images="3BetPort.png" height="400" %} 
Practicing my skills and trying to draw a portrait in OnShape! Learned program is better for straighter edges. This was a very fun exercise  

## Spinning Top
{% include image-gallery.html images="4Top.png" height="400" %} 
Made a drawing of dimensions. Found correct collet size, faced off the piece and zeroed the y-axis. Changed tools for chamfer and semi-circle. Measured as I went to make sure was centered and matched drawing. Polished and deburred the edges after and now have a little top  

## Assembly of Temperature Sensor
{% include image-gallery.html images="5Temp.png" height="400" %} 
Created a temperature sensor to flash light if got too hot. Interfacing Arduino, 3D printed battery holder, soldering, assembly on SolidWorks of it put together. Reports temperature on and LCD.  

## 3 Rings on Lathe
{% include image-gallery.html images="6Rings.png" height="400" %} 
Got metal pipe and cut to smaller size. First cut to outer diameter, then made a hole in the center of the rod. Cut into rings and deburred.  

## T-Nut on Manual Mill
{% include image-gallery.html images="7Tnut.png" height="400" %} 
To practice skills on the mill, I grabbed a T-nut and tried to recreate it. I found the axises, faced off the part, cut the passes, cut and tapped a hole in desired location. Realized that the hardest part of milling was planning and making things exact.  

## Mechanical Piece
{% include image-gallery.html images="8Mech.png" height="400" %} 
SolidWorks drawing of model built to be able to slid into the rungs of a mill and hold product while cutting. Adhereing to typical engineering standards in drawing  

## Solidworks Assembly and Calculations
{% include image-gallery.html images="9Gears.png" height="400" %} 
Gear assembly, working with mates in SolidWorks. Inserted all mechanical components and then did study of how fast was moving, and comparing the velocities of different sized gears.
